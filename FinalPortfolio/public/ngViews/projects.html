                    Green Dot's Knowledge Sharing Platform was inflexible, hard to
                    navigate, and required a lot maintenance from the IT and
                    Application teams. As the Technical Project Manager, I was tasked to vet applications that would meet our needs and fill these existing gaps. After 12 months of research, design, and build, my team and I launched a brand new Knowledge Sharing Platform on WordPress that incorporated a
                    sleek design, was mobile friendly, improved processes, and received universal buy in from our national organization.</p>
